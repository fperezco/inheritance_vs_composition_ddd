## About The Project

Just a playground in PHP about Inheritance VS Composition following Domain-Driven Design Aggregates rules

#### To resume:

"Composition" favors the rule about associates Aggregates via ID not via object reference due to the polymorfism 
is build over the certainty that comments owners should be referenced via uuid and not in a parent class (due to it is not exists)

The "inheritance" version let you open two doors not DDD friendly:

1.- You are tempted to connect comments to the parent class object instead of using a uuid reference.

2.- You can as well set comments as and array inside parent class (violating the fact that both are Aggregates)

## Built With

PHP & Symfony framework
